Obesity, diabetes and the metabolic syndrome are a rapidly growing pandemic that is hitting millions of people worldwide and there is no solution in sight. While our current healthcare system is mainly focussed on treating the symptoms of these diseases, while not addressing the root cause.

It has been shown that the blood glucose response to a certain meal is an important indicator of health and that by keeping blood glucose levels stable we can prevent and even reverse the metabolic syndrome. It has also been shown that this blood glucose response is very personal (one person can have an opposite reaction to a certain meal than someone else) and thus prescribing a generalized diet is ineffective.

On <a href="https://www.myhealthplus.nl">www.myhealthplus.nl</a> people can track their dietary intake and upload their glucose data, the software will then generate a report with personalized diet and lifestyle advice. 

This will result in personalized diet and lifestyle advice that will be science-based and actually easier to follow than a standardized diet because it can provide you with very specific foods that you can better avoid that you might not even enjoy (for example tomatoes) while at the same time comforting you with the information that some foods that you really enjoy (for example pasta) might not be as bad for you as you might think.
